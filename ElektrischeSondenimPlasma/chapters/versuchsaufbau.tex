\section{Experimental setup and procedure}\label{sec:versuchsaufbau}

The experimental setup is schematically drawn in figure \ref{fig:setup}. The voltages $\subsc{U}{E, S}$ could be tuned by hand and both the current and the voltage of the probe was directly transmitted to a LabView program. Initially the characteristic of the single probe for Argon at five different gas pressures at constant discharge current $\subsc{I}{E}$ was measured. Only negative voltages were applied to avoid a too high current which would destroy the probe. Secondly the radial position of the tip of the probe was changed. This was done for $\subsc{I}{E} = \unit[5, \, 10 \text{ and } 20]{mA}$. The third task was to measure the characteristic for the double probe, also at five different gas pressures. The last task was to measure the Paschen law. The whole procedure was repeated for Helium.
