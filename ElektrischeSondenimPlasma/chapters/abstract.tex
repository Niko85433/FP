\initial{P}\textbf{lasma, often called the fourth state of matter, is a particle mixture whose components are (partially) split up into ions and electrons. There are some characteristic quantities like electron temperature and electron density, distinguishing the different types of plasma like glow discharge, lightnings or aurorae. Plasma is used to generate light or in surface technologies like reactive-ion etching. To determine important quantities, the Langmuir probe is the most important tool in plasma diagnostics. In this experiment, the single and the double probes are used to study plasma parameters in a glow discharge, depending on different initial conditions.}
